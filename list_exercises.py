# 4. Lets say you are running a 5 km race. Write a program that,
#    1. Upon completing each 1 km asks you "are you tired?"
#    2. If you reply "yes" then it should break and print "you didn't finish the race"
#    3. If you reply "no" then it should continue and ask "are you tired" on every km
#    4. If you finish all 5 km then it should print congratulations message

# for i in range (0,5):
#     print(f"You ran {i+1} miles")
#     if (i== 0 or 1 or 2 or 3):
#         tired = input("are you tired :")
#         if tired== 'yes':
#             break
#             print("you didn't finish the race")
# if i == 4:
#     print("You have completed the  race!")
# else:
#     print(f"you didnt finished the race you still ran {i+1} miles")

#
# 5. Write a program that prints following shape
# ```
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# ```

# for i in range(1,6):
#     a=''
#     for j in range (i):
#         a+= '*'
#     print(a)
